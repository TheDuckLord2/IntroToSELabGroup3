# **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ecommerce-store-project.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd ecommerce-store
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Set Up the Database**

1. Open your MySQL client or MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_store;
```

### **4. Configure the Project**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to securely store your database credentials. Add the following content to the `.env` file:

```
DB_NAME=ecommerce_store
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

Then, update the `DATABASES` settings in the `ecommerce_store/settings.py` file to match your local MySQL setup:

```python
from decouple import config

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': config('DB_NAME'),
        'USER': config('DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': config('DB_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': config('DB_HOST'),
        'PORT': config('DB_PORT'),
    }
}
```

### **Install `python-decouple`**

Ensure you have the `python-decouple` package installed to use the `config` function:

```bash
pip install python-decouple
```

> **Note**: Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to your repository.



### **5. Run Database Migrations**

Apply the migrations to create the necessary tables in your MySQL database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### **6. Run the Development Server**

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
